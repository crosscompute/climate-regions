# Climate Regions: Your Climate Classification Tool
Welcome to Climate Regions, your go-to tool for identifying the climate region of any geographical location using just the coordinates of longitude and latitude. This user-friendly tool is a powerful solution not only for those driven by curiosity but also for professionals in fields such as geography, climate science, environmental studies, and even for travelers planning their next adventure.

## How to Use the Climate Regions Identification Tool
### Inputs:
Our tool simplifies global climate classification by requiring just two input variables: 'latitude' and 'longitude'. These numerical values specify the precise global coordinates you wish to explore.

- Latitude: Latitude values range from -90 (South Pole) to +90 (North Pole). They indicate how far north or south the location is from the equator.
- Longitude: Longitude values range from -180 to +180, determining how far east or west the location is from the Prime Meridian that runs through Greenwich, London.
In the respective input fields, input the latitude and longitude of your desired location.

### Running the Climate Regions Tool:
After inputting the latitude and longitude, click the "Continue" button to initiate the climate classification process. Our advanced algorithms will then assess your specified location and identify its climate region.

### Outputs:
Once processed, the Climate Regions tool will provide you with 'climate_region' and 'summary', giving you valuable insight into your specified location.

- Climate Region: This output details the climate classification of the given coordinates, which could range from a tropical rainforest or a desert to a tundra region.
- Summary: This output offers a more comprehensive explanation of the identified climate region, encompassing information about typical weather patterns, temperature ranges, precipitation levels, and more.

## Exploring Different Climate Regions:
Feel free to run multiple locations and compare their climate regions. Simply input a new set of latitude and longitude, hit "Continue", and the tool will generate fresh outputs.
