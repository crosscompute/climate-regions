# Estimated Heating and Cooling Costs Using Degree Days

- [Degree days](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_day) measure how hot or cold a location was compared to a baseline temperature and indicate how much heating or cooling might be needed for a building in that location.
- Heating degree days (HDD) measure how cold the temperature was on a given day or during a period of days.
- Heating degree days cost (HDD_COST) estimates how much would be spent on heating in a year.
- Cooling degree days (CDD) measure how hot the temperature was on a given day or during a period of days.
- Cooling degree days cost (CDD_COST) estimates how much would be spent on cooling in a year.
