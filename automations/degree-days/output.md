# Degree Days Analysis Tool

## Your Degree Day Report:

- Summary: This is a text summary of the Degree Days analysis, providing insights on the estimated energy requirements based on the geographic location and the entered cost parameter.

## Understand Your Output
The Degree Days Analysis Tool provides a detailed output that allows you to understand energy requirements based on Degree Days for the specific geographical coordinates you entered. Let's delve into what the output means and how you can interpret it:

### Summary:
The Summary text provides an overview of the analysis. It will detail the Degree Days computed from the location defined by the latitude and longitude you've entered. The Degree Days value is a measure of how much (in degrees), and for how long (in days), outside air temperature was above or below a certain base temperature. This data is crucial in energy analysis because it can indicate how much heating or cooling might be needed for a building in that location.

Additionally, the Summary may also provide insights into how the cost parameter you provided ties into the Degree Days analysis. For example, if the cost represents the price of a certain energy resource, the Summary could give you an understanding of how variations in Degree Days might impact the cost of heating or cooling a building.

### Cost Chart:
The Cost Chart is a visual representation of the correlation between Degree Days and the cost parameter. This could show, for example, how changes in Degree Days might affect the cost of energy.

By interpreting this chart, you can better understand patterns of energy demand throughout different temperature conditions. If, for instance, the chart indicates a higher cost during times of extreme temperatures, this might mean that there will be a higher demand for energy (and hence higher costs) during very cold or hot periods.

The Cost Chart can also help you foresee potential energy cost fluctuations and, therefore, better plan for energy budgeting or make adjustments to energy usage during certain periods.
