# Degree Days Analysis Tool

Welcome to Degree Days Analysis Tool. An ideal resource for utility companies, energy analysts, and environmental scientists, this application analyzes energy consumption and demand patterns using Degree Days. By simply inputting geographical coordinates, including longitude and latitude, and a cost parameter, our Degree Days Analysis Tool generates detailed energy consumption insights for any location.

## Enter Your Data
- Latitude: Enter the precise decimal latitude of the location you want to study. Latitude ranges from -90 (South Pole) to 90 (North Pole).

{ latitude }

- Longitude: Provide the exact decimal longitude of the location. Longitude spans from -180 to 180.

{ longitude }

- Cost: Input your specific cost parameter, such as the per-unit energy cost in your area or an average energy cost you want to assess.

{ cost }
