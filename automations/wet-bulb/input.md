## Instructions for Using the Wet Bulb Calculator
Our tool is designed with simplicity and usability in mind. Let's walk through how to use it:

### Provide the Inputs
On the main screen of the Wet Bulb Calculator, you'll find two input fields: 'Temperature' and 'Relative Humidity'.

- Temperature: Enter the ambient or 'dry bulb' temperature here. Please note, the unit of temperature isn't specified in the tool, so ensure you maintain consistency in the unit you choose (either degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit) for accurate calculations.

- Relative Humidity: Enter the relative humidity in this field. It's a measure of the amount of moisture in the air compared to the maximum amount the air could hold at the given temperature, expressed as a percentage.

### Submit your Inputs
Once you've entered the values, click the 'Continue' button. Our tool will process the inputs, running calculations in the back-end to determine the wet bulb temperature.

### Understand the Output
In the next page, the tool will return the wet bulb temperature.

The wet bulb temperature is the lowest temperature that can be reached by the evaporation of water only. It's a key parameter used in many applications, such as meteorology, HVAC system design, and more. Again, the unit of this output will be consistent with the unit you used for the input temperature.

## Understanding the Wet Bulb Calculator Outputs
When it comes to interpreting the output of our Wet Bulb Calculator, it's important to understand what the wet bulb temperature means.

This temperature is a crucial parameter for understanding the properties of air under certain conditions. It's particularly relevant in designing HVAC systems, predicting weather patterns, and conducting various environmental studies. The wet bulb temperature is typically lower than the 'dry bulb' temperature (ambient temperature), and it's affected by the rate of evaporation from a moistened surface, which in turn is influenced by the relative humidity of the air.

By mastering the Wet Bulb Calculator, you're equipped with a tool that can deliver critical data for your scientific studies, environmental predictions, and technical designs.
